HTTP:

        Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a method for encoding and transporting information between a web browser and a web server. 
        HTTP is the primary protocol for transmission of information across the Internet.

HTTP/1.1:
        => It allows the reusage of datas.
        => HTTP/1.1 was created in 1997 
        => Multiplexing:
             HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it
        =>Server push:
             To speed up web performance, both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 compress HTTP messages to make them smaller.
        => It works on the textual format.
        => It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages


HTTP/2:
        => Enables the transfer of large amount of data/information at the same time .
        => HTTP/2 was created in 2015
        => Multiplexing:
            HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
        => Server push:
            HTTP/2 uses a more advanced compression method called HPACK that eliminates redundant information in HTTP header packets. 
            This eliminates a few bytes from every HTTP packet. 
        => It works on the binary protocol.
        => It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages
