Difference between window object and document object:

Window Object:
        => It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.
        => It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.
        => Whenever a window appears on the screen to display the contents of the document, the window object is created. 
        => The window is part of BOM, not DOM.
        => We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window
        => Syntax: 
                    window.property_name;
        => Example:
                    window.innerHeight : will return the height of the content area of the browser

Document Object:
        => It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.
        => It represent a web page that is loaded in the browser.
        => By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page. 
        => With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page.
        => The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model)
        => The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.
        => Syntax:
                    document.property_name;
        => Example:
                    document.title :  will return the title of the document
